Im tired of CRM's, I think they dont work for the sales rep, all tha data its in their mails, whatsapps, calls, virtual meetings.
In the era of agenitc we need something to help the reallt empoer the salesrep.
   So this CRM is for compliance and hygenie, but also integrates a presales that helps the salesrep to have ebyrthing orgnanized, that tell them some ideas during a meeting about success cases and sales plays.
